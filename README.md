HOW TO USE:

* Run every cell in parity_twist.ipynb to generate the dataset of all possible game states
* If interested, run the cells in analysis.ipynb to see how player 2 can always win
* Run parity_twist.py to play with humans, or a bot that implements the lookup table generated by parity_twist.ipynb

NOTE: this requires polars and pygame
